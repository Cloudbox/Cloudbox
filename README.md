Cloudbox is an Ansible playbook for deploying a cloud media server stack on an Ubuntu server with the use of Docker containers.

This project is limited to specifically 16.04 Ubuntu LTS and AMD64/Intel64 (no ARM support) machines and designed for fresh systems. Do not install on an already setup server, or prepare for unintended consequences.
